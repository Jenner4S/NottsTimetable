# UoN Timetable Organizer
* * *

This app allows any University Of Nottingham Student With an iOS Device to pick the classes they are taking & it will show a Day by Day View of their Timetable.

They can constantly update their classes which allows students to imagine how their schedules will be like depending on the classes they take.

It will also show details about the location of the class & lecturer.
